            <h2>Welcome to my space!</h2>
            <p id="start-point"> I am currently a student at AltSchool Africa, focusing on frontend engineering. 
                After exploring their mission and principles, I was frantically convinced to choose AltSchool 
                as my starting point on the journey to becoming a frontend engineer. I believe AltSchool offers the ideal environment 
                for me to build the fundamental skills I need to kickstart my career in the tech field. 
                Okay, lets take a pause...<a href="#end-point">we'll continue in the last paragraph.</a> 
                I want to share a little something about myself. My instructor might call it a <strong>'Short Biography'</strong>, 
                but I prefer to think of it as a <strong>'Composition about myself'</strong>,
                taking a trip back to the good old elementary school days. 
                Trust me, this one's going to be a fun ride, and I think you'll enjoy it!</p>
            <h2>Short Biography</h2>
            <p>I go by the name Ogunniyi Gaddiel Oyewole, call me <strong>'Gaa-dee-ell.'</strong> 
                I am part of a pretty big crewâ€”my parents and four awesome brothers. I'm like the 'Wednesday' of the family, 
                nestled right in the middle. I am originally from Ekiti State, Nigeria. But currently based in Osun State 
                as a Tailor/Fashion designer. I figured that diving into this tech journey would need heaps of time, 
                dedication, and consistency, so I decided to hang up my scissors and put the sewing materials away. 
                Since then, I've fully embraced this exciting adventure. Along the way, I've also dived into the world of 
            <a href="https://gaddiel.hashnode.dev/"> Technical writing,</a> which I believe will serve as another valuable avenue
                for research and undoubtedly further solidify my path in this field.</p>
            <p>I am graduate of Microbiology, Ekiti State University. Class 2007/2011. I've had several job  experiences, 
                from working as a sales associate, to being a customer representative. Working as a health facilitator 
                was my last job specification, before I embraced fashion designing. But you know what they say, right? 
                Once your passion stops payings your bills, it's time to turn it into a side hustle.<br>
                So, we promised to keep it short, didn't we? Yes, that's my quick bio. Did I manage to keep it interesting? 
                We're all good, right? High five!</p>

                <h2>Transitioning into Tech</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Curiosity and the Mystery of Technology</h3>
                        <p>Transitioning into the tech world has been one of the coolest things to happen to me. 
                            Before all the buzz about tech took center stage, I used to wonder about the mysterious world of technology. 
                            It's like this mind-boggling magic where you're connected to a computer somewhere far away, 
                            and you're interacting with folks all over the place. 
                            Ever wondered what's the secret sauce inside that computer making it tick? When I was a kid, 
                            people would say stuff like, <strong>'The white man's got witchcraft; that's how computers work.'</strong>
                            Trust me, it's way more down-to-earth than that.</p>

                        <h3>The Accelerating Role of Technology in Education and STEM</h3>
                        <p>I could be mistaken, but I want to emphasize that the COVID-19 pandemic pretty much forced rapid adaptation 
                            to remote work, online education, telemedicine, and e-commerce. People became more dependent on technology 
                            to stay connected, work, and shop, accelerating the adoption of digital tools and platforms. 
                            Following the sudden and widespread popularity of technology in recent years. 
                            The recognition of the importance of technology in education has led to increased emphasis on STEM 
                            (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education, 
                            producing a workforce that is more tech-savvy and prepared for tech-related careers.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>The Enchantment of Coding: Where Logic Meets Creativity</h3>
                        <p>We all have a driving force that fuels our passions, right? 
                            My passsion for coding not only lies on the thrilling ethusiasm of problem-solving and wild creativity.
                            It's like piecing together what might seem like a bunch of tech jargon into something pretty amazing.
                            I see coding as this cool mix of logical thinking and artistry, 
                            where lines of code are like strokes on a digital canvas. 
                            It's like creating beautiful magic from a bunch of numbers and letters.
                            I just love how it's this endless playground of ideas and possibilities in the digital world.  
                            It's where you get to build cool stuff that not only works but looks pretty good doing it!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>...and on a last note.</strong> To be candid, the tech industry undeniably offers substantial financial rewards. 
                            Possessing a skill set that not only covers your expenses but also provides for your well-being 
                            and ensures an attractive retirement plan is, without a doubt, a significant motivating factor for me.</p>

            <h2>My Goal as an AltScholar</h2>
            <p>My goal as an AltSchool student is to attain certification as a frontend engineer within the next one year.
                And my primary objective is to excel in crafting top-tier websites and web applications that prioritize efficiency, 
                accessibility, security, and user-friendliness. By doing so, I aspire to make substantial contributions to the success of projects and organizations. 
                In this pursuit, I will be committed to not only enhancing user experiences but also advancing the objectives of the organizations I collaborate with.
                Additionally, I seek to acquire more proficiency in technical writing and aim to cultivate exceptional teamwork abilities,
                positioning myself as a valuable team player and an effective leader.</p>
        </section>
        <p>Now, let's wrap up our little chat about why I chose AltSchool, <a href="#start-point"> from the first paragraph where we took a pause </a>.

            in that it explores and offers practical & functional learning with the aid of modern technology.
            I also discovered that AltSchool provides an amazing opportunity for networking, which, in my book,
            is a key ingredient for growth and unlocking opportunities in the tech world. 
            If you are seeking to acquire a robust foundation in tech, I highly recommend AltSchool.<br>
